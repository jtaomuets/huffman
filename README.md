# huffman
Huffman coding was developed during the 1950s as an efficient way to encode and reduce the size of data. Even though there are more sophisticated algorithms used today such as those used with zip and gzip files, Huffman coding is a straightforward and efficient way to reduce the size of data for transmission across a network.
